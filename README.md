# AutoCorrect
Auto-correct, fix typos, on your Windows machine.
[Watch Demo/Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rlpWzjqoXMU "Demo")

### How to use it?
1. Install [AutoHotkey 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe "AutoHotkey 1.1")
2. Open `AutoCorrect.ahk` file
3. Now it'll fix the typos automatically. No need to do anything!

More recommended steps:
1. Press `Win+R`
2. type `shell:script`
3. Put your `AutoCorrect.ahk` file here.
- Your machine will now automatically open that file when it starts, so you don't need to open it manually.


### Why should I use this?
- Fix typos without doing anything!
- We make many typing mistakes (typos) daily, like:
  - `thakn` instead of `thank`
  - `thsi` instead of `this`
  - `eb` instead of `be`
  - `remmeber` instead of `remember`
  - `isue` instead of `issue`
  - `tihnk` instead of `think`
  - `they;re` instead of `they're`
  - `normla` instead of `normal`
  - `tot he` instead of `to the`

And millions more. Fixing them each time is quick but annoying.
- This scipt will fix it autoamtically!

### Goal
- The goal is to collect common typos to make correction more efficient. Fix typos that happen when typing fast, like pressing keys in the wrong order (e.g. "thsi" for "this") or missing a key (e.g. "isue" for "issue").
- Don't make it overly "smart" by replacing words based on sentence context, as that can be annoying. For example, auto correct we have on our phones.
